<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Keeping it short until a sufficient manual is drafted.</p>

<p>Try get as many planets populated as you can</p>

<p>Populate and protect planets as fast as possible</p>

<p>You need a launch pad to build satellites</p>

<p>Satellites generate research and unlock other technologies<p>

<p>Moons generate as much matter as a matter factory</p>

<p>Farms generate colonists which can be used to populate other planets.</p>

<p>You can speed up the game with the double arrow icon, but watch out, asteroids will occur more quickly</p>

<p>Asteroids occur between every 250-1500 years depending on race</p>

<p>You can defend against asteroids with the turret</p>

<p>You can mine rhodium from the rocks in the upper left of your solar system</p>

<p>Everytime you build a satellite receiver, you will discover a new solar system</p>

<p>You can goto different solar systems by pressing the "View Galaxy" Icon</p>
